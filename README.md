Match-3 RPG style iOS game engine

This is the source code to the Match-3 RPG engine I describe in a series of articles on my blog:



This engine is not a complete game and I don't intend to ever finish it, it was just an experiment
to better understand how the mechanics of these games work.  Feel free to take from it or finish it yourself.
