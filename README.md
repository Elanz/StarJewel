Match-3 RPG style iOS game engine

This is the source code to the Match-3 RPG engine I describe in a series of articles on my blog:

(Part 1): http://www.200monkeys.com/index.php/2012/12/23/cloning-puzzle-and-dragons/

(Part 2): http://www.200monkeys.com/index.php/2012/12/23/cloning-puzzle-and-dragons-board-setup-and-touch-events/

(Part 3): http://www.200monkeys.com/index.php/2012/12/23/cloning-puzzle-and-dragons-detecting-matches-and-refilling-the-board/

This engine is not a complete game and I don't intend to ever finish it, it was just an experiment
to better understand how the mechanics of these games work.  Feel free to take from it or finish it yourself.
